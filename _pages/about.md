I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of Michigan. My research interests lie in Development Economics and Public Economics. I am dedicated to analyzing how individuals and firms respond to tax policy and exploring strategies for enhancing tax compliance in developing countries. I also study the causal effects of public policies, such as public pension programs. 

Before joining Michigan, I completed a Master of Arts in Economics at Makerere University, Kampala. Additionally, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Education, majoring in Economics and minoring in Mathematics, from the same university. My previous experience includes a position as Research Analyst at the Economic Policy Research Centre (EPRC) in Uganda.
